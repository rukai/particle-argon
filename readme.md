Provides basic abstractions for the LED and MODE button.
Examples demonstrate how to access wifi via the [esp-at-driver](https://github.com/rukai/esp-at-driver) crate.
Wifi support over the ESP32 coprocessor is a WIP.

My board hasnt actually arrived yet so this is all powered on wishful thinking and rust's type safety.
